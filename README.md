# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer#
MNIST Digit Recognizer 
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.

### Overview
This project uses a deep learning model to achieve about **99% accuracy** on the MNIST dataset.

**Tools Used:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

---

### How It Works
- Preprocessed 28x28 grayscale images
- Built a CNN with convolution + pooling layers
- Trained for multiple epochs using categorical crossentropy loss
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

---

###  Model Performance
| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Accuracy | ~99% |
| Loss | Very low (after ~5 epochs) |


---

### Next Steps
- Experiment with different optimizers and architectures  
- Try on other datasets like CIFAR-10 or Fashion-MNIST
